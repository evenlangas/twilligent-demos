# WebGL Build Template

This can be used as a template when hosting websites with a WebGL build.

Remember to always name the build files WebGLBuild.framework.js, WebGLBuild.loader.js, WebGLBuild.data and WebGLBuild.wasm and place them within a folder called "Build". If not, the index.html will not refer to the correct files.
